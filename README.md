# ADM-HM1

First homework for the Algorithm Methods of Data Mining.

In the `scripts` file there are the solutions to all the exercises organised in Jupyter Notebook.

In the PDF file there is the complete list of submissions.

Since I've never used Python, in some exercises I helped myself to write the code with the solutions and with other people's answers that are on the _Discussion_ page. I showed in which exercise I used the solutions in the notebook.
