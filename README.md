# ADM-HM1

First homework for the Algorithm Methods of Data Mining.

In the `scripts` file there are the solutions to all the exercises organised in Jupyter Notebook.

In the PDF file there is the complete list of submissions.

In some exercises I helped myself to write the code with the solutions and with other people's answers that are on the _Discussion_ page. I showed in which exerxise I used the solutions in the notebook.
